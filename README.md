# Electric UI Interval Sender Library

Utility library to assist sending Electric UI messages to a user interface at a developer defined interval. Reduce communications overhead for minimal increase in flash/ram usage.

## Getting Started

The library assumes you have downloaded, installed and successfully used [`electricui-embedded`](https://github.com/electricui/electricui-embedded).

For Arduino users, clone or download this library into your library folder. Typically "~/Arduino/libraries/" or similar.

For other microcontrollers, import the sources like any other C library. This library is setup the same way as the `electricui-embedded`.

Reference the examples for basic usage and more complex UI-negotiated control.

For for more detail, [browse the docs](https://electricui.com/docs/hardware/extensions).
